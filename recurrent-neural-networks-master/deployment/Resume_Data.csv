Simple Portfolio Generation and Prediction using Monte Carlo Simulations
May 2022
Designed and developed a simple model for portfolio construction and performance prediction. The portfolio was constructed based on the investment amount and risk and returns appetite of an investor. The predictions were made using Monte Carlo Simulations with Convolutional Neural Networks. The risk and returns profiles of the portfolios constructed were determined using their historical Alpha and Beta based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The prediction model estimated the daily worth of the portfolio for the next 100 days since running. The pricing data needed for prediction was obtained from Yahoo Finance.

Shell script to clone AODV Routing Protocol in Network Simulator 2
https://www.researchgate.net/ publication/326490439_Shell_Script_to_Clone_AODV_Routing_Protocol_in_Network_Simulator-2 March 2018
The paper was done on the development of a shell script to ease the work of developers and researchers by showing the procedure to clone the AODV protocol automatically. The shell script clones the AODV protocol by modifying 18 C++ and TCL files of the protocol and NS-2 suite by automatically inserting the code in exact files at an exact position. The proposed script can clone the AODV protocol faster with just one execution of the shell script. This methodology will save time and help the developers or research to focus more on their study on the protocol.

Semantic Matching: � Enhancing the Ads fill rate by proposing alternate query to the user's search query to enhance the number of relevant ads clicks and impressions. � Similarity scores of search query and product titles were used as important features widely across search and recommendation projects. � Finding the relevant keywords for the seller to bid for his advertised products to enhance the reachability.
Bayesian model to handle rare events: Created Empirical Bayesian hierarchical model for unbiased click through rate(ctr)and conversion rate(cvr) estimation of rare events(new products with no historical data/products with very less interaction data) .
Real Time Bidding: RTB is a solution for sellers at Ads platform to adjust their bidding based on traffic quality in real time using machine learning to improve returns on advertising spent(ROAS) and platform revenue.
Free Trial:

� To increase seller's adoption on Ads service while improving merchant's sales and company revenue by offering free trial of ads service for fixed period(three months) with fixed budget to selected set of merchants. � Seller's attributes and historical based features were used to train the machine learning model. � Return on advertising spent (ROAS) was used as performance metric to evaluate sellers conversion from free trial to additional recharge to allocate budget for the use of service continuation .
Feature Store Generation: Unified data store to address the need of all data science projects related data requirements to ads platform to avoid redundancy and optimize query run time and cost .
