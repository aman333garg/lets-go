About Drivetrain

Drivetrain was founded in 2021 by ex-Googlers Alok and Tark who have built and scaled large businesses. Alok was a Partner at Elevation Capital, where he led the investments in B2B SaaS. Before that, he was CEO of Freecharge, and CPO & COO of RedBus, and led both companies to successful exits. Tark was VP of Engineering at Freshworks, where he led ML and Data Platform teams and launched Freshsales. Prior to that, he founded a company that was acquired by Freshworks. 



Both have deep experience in the SaaS business model and have seen the challenges faced by founders and business leaders at close quarters. They realized that managing complexity and scaling SaaS businesses in a predictable manner is a hard science. This became their mission and Drivetrain was the result.

Product Analytics - JD.pdf,"what is CRED?
CRED is an exclusive community for India's most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. To build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.
here's a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.
here's what will be in store for you at CRED once you join as a part of the team
what will you do:
 drive the business proactively through insights to identify product opportunities and threats
 own the quantitative and qualitative narratives of the business function that enable the overall health
 identify the input levers and design the appropriate outcome metrics in order to achieve optimization and efficient functioning of product
 tackle problems in creative and logical ways and consistently brainstorm alternative solutions
 deeply understand what matters most to members and use these insights to improve the user experience
 create effective working relationships with stakeholders by managing objectives and expectations and drive data-centered decisions
you should apply if you:  hold 1-5 years of experience analyzing product and business using analytical and problem-solving skills  are strong with first principle thinking and applying analytics to real life business problems  exhibit excellent storytelling abilities and are able to connect the dots to explain the

essence to the stakeholders  have the ability to comprehend the power of analytics as not just a support function but
also as an enabling charter that deserves a front seat vision  are an expert in extracting the descriptive and predictive insights from data  are fluent in sql or any relational database with experience working on large datasets and
pipelines; alternatively R/Python are good to have  possess adept knowledge of reporting dashboards that give timely relevant insights  belong to the school of thought to create and leverage analytical frameworks  have subscribed and champion every analysis within the realm of quality, delivery and
reliability  are able to access, analyze and resolve complicated issues, and distill that complexity into
simple and concise communication
how is life at CRED?
working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.
hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves and a comprehensive health insurance.
to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. There are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. Since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.
there are many more such eccentricities that make CRED what it is but that's for one to discover. if you feel at home reading this, get in touch.
